# Reinforcement learning for FrozenLake

Reinforcement Learning to solve the FrozenLake environment from Gym.  
The following modules have been implemented:
<ol>
    <li> Value iteration
    <li> Policy iteration
    <li> Tabular Q learning
</ol>


## Installation
`` git clone https://github.com/rnitin/frozen_lake.git``  
`` pip install -r requirements.txt``


## Description
### VI.ipynb
